# Making good use of volunteers at a nonprofit

We love getting volunteer help when it's a good experience for the volunteers and helps the mission. We usually find there are three modes of volunteering that tend to be successful:
1. An hour or two of advice from a subject matter expert that rapidly accelerates our team's understanding of the subject
1. A dedicated block of time (say 1 week) of development work, partnering with our team, to build a new system from zero to one, and give the team the knowledge to take it from there
1. Sustained commitment at a low level of effort (say, 2 hours per month for a year) to provide ongoing counsel while we're working on a new thing

Timing can be tricky here. We have to time it for when our team has the space to make full use of the help. It can be helpful to maintain a list of volunteer needs, so that when volunteers appear, we have something on offer.
