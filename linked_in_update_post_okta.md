Dee Luo and I were thrilled to speak with over a thousand members of Okta's product teams about innovation as a tech nonprofit. 

Over two different sessions, we talked about these four areas:
* Digital Transformation and Building Tech for Impact
* Cybersecurity Challenges in the Nonprofit Sector
* Data
* Social Responsibility and Tech Ethics

Things we highlighted:
* Need for field-level SaaS products serving related nonprofit orgs around the world
* Innovation as building out infrastructure to support many helplines. Our use of a single Okta tenant to support multiple Flex instances for multiple customers.
* Security -- noting some were not using HTTPS
* Integrating with Azure via Okta identity providers
* Convention over configuration -- make best practices for security the default. Don't assume your users are all tech-savvy with IT and security teams
* Think about user needs rather than cool feature
* Innovation isn't always about the latest cool technology, but about fulfilling a real user need with existing technology.
* Nonprofits and especially non-tech-aware organizations can be resistant to change; need support to adopt new technologies. And they have very limited IT budgets and understanding.

In the follow-up discussion, we had these points:
**Digital Transformation and Building Tech for Impact: Discuss specific examples of innovative technology implementations at the nonprofit and how company products are used.**
* One identity organization. Multiple Twilio instances. Region-specific AWS. Terraform.
* The innovation is nonprofit SaaS
* some customization
* they are not special snowflakes
* One tenant for all customers
* Azure integration

**Cybersecurity Challenges in the Nonprofit Sector: Exploring the unique cybersecurity challenges faced by nonprofits, including limited resources and the implications for vulnerable populations.**
* MFA not well-known or adopted.
* Password managers, etc, still too high-tech for many people.
* Cloud computing not practical due to internet, cost, data sovereignty issues
* Lack of budget for IT, IT staff not as available.
* Lack of simple frameworks for security
* Convention over configuration
* Thailand - 45 minutes of trying to log in. Stupid but no, extraordinary at something I'm not.
  * password rules didn't work in thai. there are no upper case letters
* Some are used to HTTP over internal network -- zero trust is not a thing; heavy focus on firewalls
* time machine -- 15 years behind
* Zambia didn't have email addresses
* speak to rich vs poor nonprofit. know what your product isn't good for.

**Data: Highlight how they use data in their operations and how technology enables their data collection, analysis, and utilization for informed decision-making.**
* Jamaica MSC story
* CHI export
* Starting to look at AI
* Full story, errors
* Counselor efficiency

**Social Responsibility and Tech Ethics: Share their approach to ethical considerations of technology development. Share insights from the speaker's career journey and shifts from tech to nonprofit sector, etc.**
* Helplines own their data
* Open and transparent about where data goes
* Open source
* AI - got permission
* It takes longer, but we are highly trusted
* Try to be aware of user needs and circulate within team
