- nonprofits have similar needs but are more lean and may lack technical background. cookbooks and sound defaults can be helpful. they do not have the time or money to take your certification classes or hire someone who does.
- convention over configuration
- nonprofits different:  bursty, one-off funding. power and internet issues. local restrictions -- how international is your customer base?
- harm reduction over perfect security
- compliance mode, eg washington state requirements. "this meets soc2 x.x.x"
- whenever you log in, think about what it would take to make this hard. there's someone in thailand or zambia who doesn't have that thing who is having a really hard time right now.
