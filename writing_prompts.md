# Eng Leadership Prompts

Prompts that emerged.

## Mentoring and career development
- very important to me  
- my main tools: ladders and reviews/goals and frequent feedback
- use a ladder to show the big picture
- don't sluff on performance reviews. Look at the big picture and look for small corrections.
- Performance review feedback should only focus in on 1-3 points. Does not need to be exhaustive. Should agree to goals to work on those issues.
- Revisit once a quarter, even if very informally
- goals are tricky; build them around skills rather than specific to-dos. Look for opportunities in work that arises.
- encourage people to mentor each other
- be specific about feedback. this can be very hard.
- do pips
- don't trust any specific measures too much
- specific stories of growing people?

## Managing distributed (offshore and onshore plus time zones) developers
- 

## Hiring
- the jd is the template for the rest of the process. work through it carefully. qualifications should be things you plan to interview for. a good jd will serve you well; it's like a one-pager.
- run jd through a gendered language checker
- come up with scoring for resume screening, if you can
- we use cover letters, though they can be a distraction
- initial recruiter screen
- phone screen
- coding assignment (< 2 hours)
- full loop
- debrief
- referrals
- build a mental model of candidates and picture them in the role
- a lot comes down to the environment when you bring them in; onboarding
