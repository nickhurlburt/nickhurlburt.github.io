# My Strengths

When I did my StrengthsFinder in 2015, it said my top five strengths were:

1. Analytical: People who are especially talented in the Analytical theme search for reasons and causes. They have the ability to think about all the factors that might affect a situation.
2. Arranger: People who are especially talented in the Arranger theme can organize, but they also have a flexibility that complements this ability. They like to figure out how all of the pieces and resources can be arranged for maximum productivity.
3. Restorative: People who are especially talented in the Restorative theme are adept at dealing with problems. They are good at figuring out what is wrong and resolving it.
4. Individualization: People who are especially talented in the Individualization theme are intrigued with the unique qualities of each person. They have a gift for figuring out how people who are different can work together productively.
5. Context: People who are especially talented in the Context theme enjoy thinking about the past. They understand the present by researching its history.

What does this mean in a role?

I have a strong pull toward systems thinking. In a leadership role, I primarily focus on setting up the systems to help the organization succeed by assembling individuals in such a way that their greater success feeds into the larger success. I tend to analyze the current situation for what's going right and what's lacking, and especially seek improvement by identifying the context and causes for areas in need of improvement, and working to arrange the systems and individuals to make things better. This necessarily includes audience-appropriate empathy toward each person to help them grow and excel in a place of psychological safety. As a member of an organization, I will extend that systems thinking out to grasping the larger picture of the organization's goals, how it functions, and how my part of it fits in. This often leads to me providing insights that help the organization overall, or that help other teams.

What does this mean about what I enjoy in a role?

I enjoy roles where I can exercise this systems thinking behavior while also leading people toward a goal while helping them grow. Exercising that behavior frequently means having enough information and access to be able to assemble my own understanding. Additionally, I enjoy working on something that helps to solve important problems in the world, while growing a greater understanding of the causes and possible solutions.
