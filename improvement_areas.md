# Improvement Areas

This list came from reading a user guide from a CEO. It included certain things that prompted an emotional response in me because I was not sure I was measuring up in my current actions. I will share the general themes here:

1. Metrics and quantative measures
2. Setting specific plans and strategies
3. Setting and holding high performance expectations
4. Awareness of broader industry patterns

These are all areas I want to work toward improving.
