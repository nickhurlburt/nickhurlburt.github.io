# Dealing with Stress

I recently took a week of staycation. It was the first time I took more than a couple days off in almost two years, and especially the first time I took any time off since moving into a new and difficult role, and following a big crunch. I spent that time however I wanted, which included hiking every day, meeting up with people, and a lot of reading. 

As it got later in the week, I began to feel nervous about going back to work on Monday. During previous vacations, I've come back rested but by lunchtime the first day I already felt just as overwhelmed as I did before I left. I really wanted to avoid this, and spent considerable time thinking about what to do differently this time.

My basic algorithm to deal with this involved starting a new journal kept specifically for this reason. In addition, I resolved to (at least attempt to) be more mindful of my internal state. This combined into a plan to notice when I was feeling stressed, overwhelmed, frightened, and at that time:

1. Notice my internal state: feelings, heartbeat, breathing, etc
1. Repeat one of a list of mantras kept in the journal
1. Write in the journal what I'm feeling, the context in which it's come about, and any stories I'm telling myself -- immediately if possible, or later if not
1. Later on, weekly perhaps, review the journal entries and watch for patterns, especially patterns where improvement is possible

This is grounded in two ideas: mindfulness and systems thinking. The simple mindfulness aspect is that noticing what's happening is often tantamount to dealing with it. I might sense my heartbeat rising and thinking, "Oh, my heartbeat is rising. This is because this kind of call tends to make me feel nervous. This is normal. Also, I know I am capable of handling this and people are unlikely to notice, so stay calm and carry on." And eventually my body relaxes as I move through it.

The second aspect is the systems thinking. Here is where I notice patterns. For example, many of the times I feel frustrated or stressed are when there is unclear data or procedures, and I have to make a series of judgment calls ungrounded in any kind of principle. Okay, then one way to help with that is to establish principles for the issues that come up most.

So far, this has worked well. Stress still arises of course, but I have been better at catching it. The journal helps to capture it in real-time. Work time allotted to system improvement is rare, but at least I know where to focus when it's available. This approach may break down -- or more likely evolve -- but that's okay, since the foundational concepts of mindfulness and systems thinking will still be valid. They have been useful over thousands of years, and there are very good odds they'll last for the rest of my life.
